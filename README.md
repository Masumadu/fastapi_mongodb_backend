- [💪 Motivation](#motivation)
  - When I started as a python backend developer, I always struggled when it comes to designing,
  - structuring or architecting my application to suit the growing needs of my clients.
  - I read a lot of books about software architecture and design principles. These helped
  - me to come up with this design to help serve as a template for new developers. This can
  - serve as a guide for new python developers to build upon.
